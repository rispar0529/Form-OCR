# Form OCR

The project uses the Tesseract OCR to scan a pre-filled Web Form and extract data of the fields in the form, to then fill the present empty form.

## Initialization/Installation

```
git clone https://github.com/KshAbo/Form-OCR.git /Your/local/file/path

npm install
```
You can now host the website by running the command
